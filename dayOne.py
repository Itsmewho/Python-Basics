# print("hello " + input("What is your name?"))
# input will change when given this is kind of a blackbox just accept it i guess


# print(len(input("what is your name?")))
# ----  the len function will give you the length of a string.


# name = input("what is your name?")
# print("hello " + name + "!")
# --- if you want to show your input save it a a var.


# name = input("what is your name? : ")

# length = len(name)

# print("Hello " + name + "!" + " your name has: " + str(length) + " characters in it!")


# reverce a string via a temporatie var:

# a = input()
# b = input()

# c = a
# a = b
# b = c

# print("a: " + a)
# print("b: " + b)
