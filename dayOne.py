# print("hello " + input("What is your name?"))
# input will change when given this is kind of a blackbox just accept it i guess

# print(len(input("what is your name?")))
# the len function will give you the length of a string. 

name = input("what is your name?")

print("hello " + name + "!")

#if you want to show your input save it a a var.
