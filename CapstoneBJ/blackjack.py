# Create a simple version of bj

# make the list for de cards
# make some art for print numbers

# make a function for the logic like 1+1=2 and 
# make a function for check if number is higher then 21 game ends with result
# this function olso check if <17 then pick an other cards
# let this function keep adding till player types in yes or no
# if player puts in wrong input ask again till right answer is given
# make a function for the computer(let it play like human?)
# show only its first card
# if computer is bust player wins else:
# make a function Compare results to check whos the winner, loser, draw.

# Use random module for picking cards[keep in mind A's = 1 or 11 depending if player is > 21, k,q,j are 10]
# Don't to the plit decks. Dont overthink or complicate it.
